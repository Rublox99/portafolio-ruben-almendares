            <div className='w-10/12 text-lg phone:w-full phone:text-justify'>
              <p className='my-2'>Technology has been my friend since childhood, generating global interest in that daily abstraction about 
              digital innovations and the logic behind them. Driven by this to be a systems engineer, I have been able to 
              learn several programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, as well as understand the logical and practical
              bases of MySQL, OracleDB, Networking Logic and programming in general.</p>
              <p className='my-2'>Meanwhile, as a self and lifelong learner, I have learned about Web Development technologies like HTML5, CSS5 
              and Javascript, as well as frameworks like React.js with utility libraries like Next, Node, Tailwind and complementary 
              technologies like Vite, EmailJS and LocalStorage.</p>
              <p className='my-2'>My focus is to improve as software and frontend developer to keep my knowledge up to date with quality practices and 
              to be able to create art through programming environments.</p>
              <p className='my-2'>I am a person motivated by creativity, personal growth and work excellence, pillars that allow me to bring a fresh 
              perspective to my work while being able to adapt to environments that require it. For this reason, I have dedicated 
              my skills, time and dedication (while learning even more) to the creation of this portfolio, which will showcase 
              myself and some of my projects.</p>
